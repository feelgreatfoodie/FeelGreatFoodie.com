        <h1>Here's the cool thing about Cooking...</h1>
        <p>
          “Get down!” (Insert best Arnold Schwarzeneggar voice here) I yell, as an explosion goes off to my right. And to my left. And behind me!! I dive onto ground of aisle at the 7-Eleven somewhere in middle America. The explosions going off are the landmines
          of health-destroying processed foods lining the shelves. I crawl to the drink case, looking for salvation… only to find high fructose corn syrup and sugar water everywhere!
          <p>
            Hunger and thirst crisis persist! I regain my composure as I pull myself off the ground to the disbelieving stares of the Salt of the Earth in line at the cash register. Walking outside, I survey the land for a remedy to my nutrition attack. Fast food
            chains and a dusty lot are all that meets the eye. But wait, at the corner I spy a road-side fruit vendor. My prayers are answered… but I wonder if it’s going to be organic. Hmmmm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does this sound like your every day? Traversing the streets of your town and the inner aisles of your grocery or convenience store? I finally have awakened as if from a dream, blanketed upon me by the FDA, USDA, Kraft, General Mills, Cargill, and Coca-Cola.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may be a bit dramatized, but I definitely cleared my train of thought in regards to food one day. I was suddenly aware of every ingredient I was ingesting and how the food I consumed was sourced. Restaurants, grocery stores, friends with crockpots…
            all of us make decisions that influence our health, energy levels, the environment, and our fellow humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is about me sharing my ponderings on the culture of food! I started off as a neophyte everything eater and slowly have been striving to become a fella who cooks delicious meals from scratch without recipes. I’m not there yet, but I’m happy to
            say I can find great recipes and mostly impress those who eat my meals. Occasionally I can even throw something together sans instructions that I’m quite pleased to eat and share. Hopefully you are still reading this… HELLO OUT THERE, IS THIS
            THING ON?… and will find yourself inspired to question all the items that go into your stomach on a daily basis. Follow my mistakes instead of making your own and grow your skills in the kitchen and as the executive chef of Restaurant Home!
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll see my blog posts, food related movie and book reviews, talks about real chefs, and regular folk in the kitchen, and most importantly recipes =_) We’ll be on a journey together! Let’s make America cook delicious food from scratch again!

        <h3>Ratatouille</h3>
        <h4>movie review</h4>
        <p>
          If you haven’t watched this Pixar film, you are missing out! Run, don’t walk, to your movie cave and get to know Remy, the lovable cooking rat! Remy is a country mouse who moves to the city and inspires a young kitchen-help lad to cook. All hell breaks
          loose when the rat-hiding-hat falls off to reveal the true master behind the curtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the movie Chef Gusteau is the legendary chef whose tagline “Anyone can cook!” Inspires the culinary leaning creature to take his talents to the top of the lad’s head. Classic food tv persona such as Ming Tsai, Emeril Lagasse, Anthony Bourdain, and
          Gordon Ramsay have done the same for me. From my humble origins in the country (Bakersfield.CA) I used to watch my mom cook and eventually started helping bit by bit. We grew fond of watching East Meets West and trying our hands at new recipes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward 15 years and I’ve spent most of this time living in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Las Vegas eating out at restaurants and being fed whatever expensive, sometimes delicious garbage restaurants decided to throw in. Thankfully, I stumble upon
          a magical lady from the midwest that wants to date me and stay at home cooking meals instead of venturing forth upon the wasteland of empty pockets, too much salt, and disempowering theaters of the eating out world…
        </p>

        <p>
          Like the patrons of where Remy is the wizard behind the curtain, my lady applauds my efforts and it causes me pure joy to continue discovering ways of improving my abilities and cooking to ever-higher degrees of excellence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, sometimes I still feel like a country rat living in the attic, sneaking into the kitchen to create an edible dish… but occasionally, moments of splendor erupt from the cutting board and oven to delight even the staunchest of gluten-free, vegan
          leaning critics!

        <h3>Salt, Sugar, Fat</h3>
        <h4>book review</h4>
        <p>
          This delightful book took me on a trip down memory lane, revisiting all the delightfully unhealthy foods of my youth and young adulthood. Michael Moss effectively describes how processed food makers toy with the amounts of salt, sugar, and fat in order
          to get us addicted to their products. An elaborate culture of chemical and psychological testing leads the scientists (not cooks) down the path of discovery to create what “foods” make it into the inner grocery aisles of our local supermarkets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of relying on qualities such as superior ingredient quality, nutrition, and performance they try to figure out the most amount of inexpensive salt, sugar, or fat components to add to the items to get a physiological addiction in place. These sources
          of the three eponymous elements are found in the strangest of places and mixed with impunity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a must read for every person that eats food that isn’t grown in the backyard and delivered with love straight to your kitchen counter and table. Let’s get excited about knowing exactly what is the food we’re eating! Let’s get excited about getting
          our hands in the dirt and on the cutting board to create delicious, nutritious food that lights up our dopamine receptors and impresses our loved ones instead of letting the FOOD GIANTS decide in their laboratories what should be filling our
          stomachs and draining our wallets.
