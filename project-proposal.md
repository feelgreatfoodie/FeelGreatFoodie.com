# Project Proposal A

### FeelGreatFoodie

This site will be intended to propagate owner's passion for home cooking from scratch, inspire the user to venture upon building skillset to do the same, provide entertaining content documenting owner's journey and discoveries, allow the user to make searches to an API for recipes to save for later use / recall / cook on their own, and interact with owner via various media.

- There is a need for people to know what is in their food, make good food decisions, and empower themselves to create it from scratch
- Every human is a candidate to be a user of the site
- The site will use HTML, CSS, javascript, API calls, localStorage

# Project Proposal B

### Alicia Rabbit Hole Hunting

This game will consist of Alicia's head on the body of Elmer Fudd, hunting rabbit holes. It will be in the style of Atari Space Invaders. As the rabbit holes advance, attempting to overtake Alicia, the user must blast them away!

- It is an inherent problem trying to get information without entering too many deep, dark rabbit holes in the WDI program
- All members of various WDI cohorts would be potential users
- Technologies would include HTML, CSS, javascript, API calls, localStorage, and magic
